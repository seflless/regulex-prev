Regulex

JavaScript Regular Expression Parser & Visualizer.

Visualizer : https://francoislaberge.com/regulex/

###Features:
- Written in pure JavaScript. No backend needed.
- You can embed the graph in you own site through html iframe element.
- Detailed error message. In most cases it can point out the precise syntax error position.
- No support for octal escape. Yes it is a feature. ECMAScript strict mode doesn't support octal escape in string,but many browsers still support octal escape in regex. I make things easier. In regulex,  DecimalEscape will always be treated as back reference. If the back reference is invalid, e.g. `/\1/`、`/(\1)/`、`/(a)\2/`,or DecimalEscape appears in charset（because in this case it can't be explained as back reference, e.g. `/(ab)[\1]/`）. Regulex will always throw an error.




API:
```javascript
var parse = require('regulex/parse');
var re = /var\s+([a-zA-Z_]\w*);/ ;
console.log(parse(re));
```
